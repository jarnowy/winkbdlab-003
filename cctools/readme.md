This is a small hack to supplement any keyboard layout with extra keys to support Norse (Danish/Norwegian), Aotearoa/ClassicalNahuatl (macron on vowels), Esperanto, Euskera (Ã±) and additional punctuation (guillemets, left quotation and exclamation marks).

Compile with `cc` and run: it shall add an inert window to your tasks, to see that it is active; close the window to disable. That's it.

Good Luck, and Happy Typing.
