# WinKBDlab 003

Experimental keyboard layouts for Windows.

These are the contents of the directories.

- cctools: a command line tool that supplements any keyboard layout with dedicated keys for Scandinavian, Aotearoa/ClassicalNahuatl, Esperanto, and Euskera, with supplemental punctuation.
- Antillais: a US keyboard layout with diacritics, mostly with dead keys; a slightly modified Microsoft Greek-Latin keyboard layout, removing most of the NoDeadKeys. Set LCID to English Caribbean, as it covers most of the languages of the region.
- Aventino: the Antillais US keyboard layout with diacritics, but merging the AltGr keys from cctools, save for Esperanto. Set LCID to Latin, as it covers both Classical (with macrons) and Ecclesiastical (with acute accents) Latin, and Italian (with grave accents), among other things.

Each directory has its own README file with details.

The 003 code corresponds to UN M49 region "North America", which includes Northern (021), Central (013), and Caribbean (029) America.

Good Luck and Happy Typing.
