A set of tools to handle multiple keyboard layouts for Windows.

These are the contents of the directories.

- cctools: a command line tool that supplements any keyboard layout with dedicated keys for Danish/Norwegian, Aotearoa/ClassicalNahuatl, Esperanto, or Euskera, with supplemental punctuation.
- antillais: a US keyboard layout with diacritics, mostly with dead keys; somewhat intersecting with the Microsoft Greek-Latin keyboard layout, removing most of the NoDeadKeys.
- aventino: a US keyboard layout with diacritics, similar to Antillais, adding macron letters for Maori, Classical Latin and Nahuatl.

Each directory has its own README file with details.

Good Luck and Happy Typing.
